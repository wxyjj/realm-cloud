Hey Ladies/gentlemen!

A sign in attempt requires further verification because we did not recognize your device. To complete the sign in, enter the verification code on the unrecognized device.

Device: %s
Verification code: %s

If you did not attempt to sign in to your account, your password may be compromised.

If you'd like to automatically verify devices in the future, consider enabling two-factor authentication on your account.

If you decide to enable two-factor authentication, ensure you retain access to one or more account recovery methods.

Thanks,

The wxy Team
